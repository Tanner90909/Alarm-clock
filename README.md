# Alarm-clock

This was one of my first projects during my time at Awesome Inc's bootcamp. I learned a lot about how javascript works and what it is capable of. I also discovered that javascript has access to date/time information that you can access and use to build your projects. This was a tough project at the time, but now I believe I could build this web app much fast and more efficiently. 

While I could refactor this repo and make this project better, I want to leave this as is to mark a time in my learning journey. This lift, at the time, felt almost impossible. How was I going to make an alarm clock with code when I had never really built anything on my own at the time? I find it beneficial to be able to look back at my older code and think about how I would refactor in the future. May revisit this project in a new repo in the future

Please take a look and let me know if you have any advice/questions!
